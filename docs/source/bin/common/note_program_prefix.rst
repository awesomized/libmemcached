PROGRAM PREFIX
..............

The prefix of this program is variable, i.e. it can be configured at build time.

Usually the client programs of ``libmemcached-awesome`` are prefixed with ``mem``, like ``memcat`` or ``memcp``.

It can be configured, though, to replace the prefix with something else like ``mc``, in case of that,
the client programs of ``libmemcached-awesome`` would be called ``mccat``, ``mccp``, etc. respectively.
